3</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> main object sought to be
attained in this correspondence was to induce the Government to
purchase two plots of land adjoining Primrose Hill Park, together
about eighteen acres, that space may be given to a great and
rapidly-increasing population for football and cricket.&nbsp; It
is probable most persons who know the wants of the district will
be of opinion that it is very desirable this should be
done.&nbsp; Every summer&rsquo;s evening there is, in the small
space of ground now available in the Regent&rsquo;s Park,
over-crowding and a badly made game.&nbsp; Many who wish to play
cannot for want of room, and two fine boys, about fourteen years
of age, complained that they were frequently hit, and the balls
crossed each other so closely that they did not know their own
ball.&nbsp; But another proposal was incidentally mentioned, upon
which there cannot be the same unanimity.&nbsp; It is suggested
that a road should be made from the top of Portland Place for
equestrians, carriages, and cabs through the Regent&rsquo;s Park,
and then to some part of Hampstead Heath.&nbsp; If any one
considering this question will stand at the top of Portland Place
and imagine the same carried on straight through the park, and
then, as far as now can be done, a park-like road made to the
Heath, and reflect how charming and healthy such a drive and ride
must be, with the bracing air and beautiful views on all sides,
easy and pleasant of access, he, perhaps, may think the scheme
worthy of very careful investigation.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Those who
are acquainted with Paris know the extraordinary change for the
better effected when a new and direct road was carried from the
Arc de L&rsquo;Etoile to the Bois de Boulogne, and it is to be
presumed that improvements will, without loss of time, be made in
Hampstead Heath, and, as in the Bois de Boulogne, suitable rides
and drives created.&nbsp; The natural advantages of the situation
are in favour of London as compared with Paris, and it is not too
much to say, if proper use is made of them, that, as a whole,
Regent&rsquo;s Park, Primrose Hill Park, and Hampstead Heath
will, for all the purposes that parks are formed, be unsurpassed
in Europe.</p>
<p>But to open the park at Portland Place may require an Act of
Parliament, and many may think the Regent&rsquo;s Park is best as
it is; nevertheless, the extreme beauty of a road through the
centre of the Regent&rsquo;s Park, in addition to being so much
nearer, ought to be a consideration.&nbsp; It will shorten the
drive to Primrose Hill going and returning, over the present
route, nearly a mile; but should this not be deemed sufficient
reason for the change, then it may be desirable to make a
carriage bridge over the canal instead of the present foot bridge
at the end of the Broad Walk, opening into the Albert Road at St.
Mark&rsquo;s Church and close by Primrose Hill.</p>
<p>Should public opinion approve this scheme there is no reason
to suppose the Government will offer any opposition to it.</p>

5</span>LETTERS.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right">The Right Hon. W. E. <span
class="smcap">Gladstone</span>, M.P.,<br />
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>Knowing the great and arduous duties you have to perform I
regret being obliged to call your attention to a very small
affair, but the case is urgent, and in a few months buildings
will be placed upon a portion of the ground.</p>
<p>Primrose Hill Park is very much used by boys as a cricket or
foot-ball ground, and on Saturdays there is not enough
space.&nbsp; Even to-day, with the ground wet and weather not
inviting, it was full, and in the summer months boys go away
because there is not room to play.</p>
<p>It may, therefore, be worthy of your consideration whether the
Government should not purchase the Eton and Middlesex Cricket
Ground, which adjoins, and consists of about twelve acres.&nbsp;
This is a private ground, and, I believe, does not pay.&nbsp;
There is another plot of about six acres which will be
immediately built upon unless the Government at once secure
it.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>This
would make a splendid addition to the park, and, perhaps,
&pound;20,000 would purchase the whole.</p>
<p>I have the honour to be, Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your obedient servant,<br />
<span class="smcap">William Ray Smee</span>.</p>
<p>Regent&rsquo;s Park North,<br />

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">William Ray
Smee</span>, Esq.,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone desires me to acknowledge the receipt of your
letter of the 6th instant.</p>
<p>I am, Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your obedient Servant,<br />
J. A. <span class="smcap">Godley</span>.</p>
<p>10, Downing Street, Whitehall,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
8<i>th</i> <i>April</i>, 1873.</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">Right Hon. W. E. <span
class="smcap">Gladstone</span>, M.P.,<br />
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I am obliged to trouble you again respecting the purchase by
the Government of about eighteen acres of land adjoining Primrose
Hill Park, for upon a portion of it the turf is now being <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>rapidly taken
away, and the land is to be built upon unless something is at
once decided.</p>
<p>There is a necessity for adding this ground to the Park.&nbsp;
The population is rapidly increasing.&nbsp; Every small open
space is closed.&nbsp; Boys and youths who cannot afford to pay
have no place for cricket except on public property.&nbsp; On
Saturdays, the young of more than half a million of people come
to Primrose Hill, or would come if there were space.&nbsp; This
afternoon there were between 2,000 and 3,000, and if the day had
been finer there would have been many more.</p>
<p>I showed to a gentleman well conversant with the district the
ground I thought ought to be purchased, and he assured me in five
years&rsquo; time, with the addition, space would be wanting, and
strongly urged the publication of the suggestion.&nbsp; That,
however, I am very unwilling to do so long as there is a prospect
of the Government acting in this business, and I therefore
venture respectfully to ask your decision.</p>
<p>Assume that the cost will be &pound;20,000, it is only part of
the interest on that amount the Government can lose.&nbsp; The
State is equally rich whether the property is in money or
land.&nbsp; The eighteen acres will make excellent sheep land,
and must yield something, and the strength and health given to
many thousand youths must speedily add to the national revenue
far more than the remainder.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>The
financial side of the question is really quite insignificant, but
the moral good done will be of the highest importance.</p>
<p>I have the honour to be, Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your obedient Servant,<br />
<span class="smcap">William Ray Smee</span>.</p>
<p>Regent&rsquo;s Park North,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26<i>th</i>
<i>April</i>, 1873.</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Before this letter was answered the following was
sent:&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">William Ray Smee</span> presents his
respects to Mr. Gladstone, and, in reference to his communication
of Saturday, wishes to say, as showing the importance of taking
into consideration the rapid increase of population; that some
years ago, when there was a field walk, but little frequented on
weekdays, from Primrose Hill to Hampstead, he proposed to Lord
Palmerston to purchase sufficient ground and make a road from the
top of Portland Place, through Regent&rsquo;s Park, and round
Primrose Hill straight to Hampstead Heath.</p>
<p>This road along its whole length was to have been Park-like,
to be used by carriages, cabs, and persons on horseback, would
have added to the beauty of <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the West of London, and if the
Government had thought it desirable, might have been made to
repay its cost by the surplus land between Primrose Hill and
Hampstead that might have been sold for villas.</p>
<p>Such a road was much wanted, and private enterprise has
already made two-thirds of it, and placed houses on both
sides.&nbsp; Nevertheless it is altogether different from what
the State would have done.&nbsp; It is neither broad nor
straight.&nbsp; It does not add to, but takes from the beauty of
the neighbourhood.&nbsp; In the meantime Hampstead Heath has
become public property, and the opportunity to make a direct
approach thereto from Regent Street in a way, which foreign
visitors to London would have greatly admired, is permanently
lost.</p>
<p>Mr. Smee mentions this, as it may still be worthy of
consideration, whether Regent&rsquo;s Park might not be opened at
Portland Place, and whether anything can now be accomplished in
the unmade portion of the road between Primrose Hill and
Hampstead Heath.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">To the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone,
M.P.,<br />

<p>Regent&rsquo;s Park North,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<i>nd</i>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>On the
6th May the letter of the 26th April was acknowledged:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">To <span class="smcap">William Ray
Smee</span>, <span class="smcap">Esq</span>.,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone desires me to acknowledge the receipt of your
letter of the 2nd instant, on a matter which seems to belong to
the province of the Metropolitan Board of Works.</p>
<p>I am, Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your obedient Servant,<br />
J. A. <span class="smcap">Godley</span>.</p>
<p>10, Downing Street,<br />

<i>May</i>, 1873.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">Right Hon. W. E. <span
class="smcap">Gladstone</span>, M.P.,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I believe with this letter, I have done all that a gentleman
in a private station can with propriety do to urge upon the
Government the purchase of two plots of land, one of six acres
and the other of twelve, adjoining Primrose Hill, to be used by
boys and youths for foot-ball and cricket.&nbsp; In a very short
time buildings will be commenced upon the smaller plot, and the
opportunity will be lost.</p>
<p>How much this ground is now wanted was apparent in the numbers
playing cricket this afternoon in the Regent&rsquo;s Park.&nbsp;
In the portion allotted to <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>boys the wickets were placed in many
cases only eight yards apart; perhaps there were 1000 boys
playing, and only those clubs were allowed that previously had
obtained permission.</p>
<p>The same applies to the ground for youths and men.&nbsp; There
were, perhaps, 800 playing; one set of wickets was close to
another on all sides, and it was marvellous the game could go on
without serious accidents.&nbsp; A sergeant of police that
happened to be passing told me it looked most dangerous, and
nothing would induce him to join; but a youth, who was playing,
said the accidents were very few,&mdash;although at first he was
much frightened, yet the danger was not so great as it
appeared.</p>
<p>The purchase of the eighteen acres would relieve this ground,
enable some of the clubs to go to Primrose Hill, and cricket
could be properly and joyfully played, and space would be given
for many who now very much wish to play but cannot.</p>
<p>I have only to add, that should next Saturday afternoon prove
fine, any gentleman, about five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon,
may ascertain how painful to witness is the present over-crowded
cricket ground of the Regent&rsquo;s Park.</p>
<p>I have the honour to be, Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your obedient Servant,<br />
<span class="smcap">William Ray Smee</span>.</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This closes the correspondence, and upon reflection it will be
apparent that a great nation can find no better and no more
economical use for a little mite of surplus revenue than its
judicious employment in providing space for healthy, innocent,
and cheap out-door amusement.&nbsp; The money so spent on behalf
of the population of this gigantic capital will double itself
over and over again.&nbsp; It is the active and the healthy that
make a nation progress.&nbsp; It is good sound sense, united with
a vigorous frame, that enables the man, advantageously to
himself, to augment the receipts of the British exchequer.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
